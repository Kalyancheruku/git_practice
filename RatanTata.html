          <b><h1>Educational Odyssey of Ratan Tata</h1></b>
          <p><b>Born on 28th December 1937 in Mumbai, Ratan Tata was the grandson of Jamshedji Tata, who was the founder of the Tata Group. He was 10 years old when his parents, Naval H Tata and Sooni Tata, decided to split and he was raised by his grandmother Lady Navajbai. To begin with the first major phase of the education of Ratan Tata, he completed his initial schooling was from Campion School Mumbai till 8th standard. Recently, Tata talked about his childhood days to the Facebook page called the “Humans of Bombay” in a three-series story. He remarked that he had a happy childhood and he and his brother faced discomfort due to their parents’ divorce as “it wasn’t as common as it is today”. When his mother remarried, the boys at school made many comments but he credits his grandmother for teaching him and his brother about retaining “dignity at all costs”. 
            He learned from his grandmother that walking away from such situations 
            is much better than fighting back against.</b></p>

            <p><b>The secondary and senior secondary education of Ratan Tata was completed at Cathedral and John Connon School, Mumbai and then at Bishop Cotton School in Shimla. He was brilliant in academics and revealed to the Facebook chronicle page, “Humans of Bombay” about how his father always would suggest him the opposite of what he wanted to do. When he said that he wanted to play the violin, his father would ask him to learn the piano and then the same happened with his interest in studying in the UK to which
                 he would find his father insisting him to pursue his higher education in the US.</b></p>
